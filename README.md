# Zombie Survival Game

This is _going to be_ a top-down zombie survival game, hopefully with some fun resource management mechanics (not annoying ones like weapons breaking). I'm also thinking this will be an open-world game, so you're free to travel anywhere on the map (as soon as you finish the tutorial level), provided you have the necessary gear to get there and to survive.
